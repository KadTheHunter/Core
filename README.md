# Info
So, the only reason this is public is so Poggit can make builds from it. I have no clue why y'all are starring this, but whatever.

# IMPORTANT
### This is NOT intended to be a one-core-fits-all plugin, please do not use it that way. Modification for personal use is ok, but please give credit, keep original credit, and do not sell this plugin.


# Credit
So I admit I used a bit of ideas and code from other plugins. Most of this Core I did myself, but some of the ideas and a bit of the code was originally done by others. Below is a rough list of those people.
- Wertzui123 (Day/Night commands)
- Xenophilicy (Night Vision)
- iiFlamiinBlaze (ChangeSign)
- EvolSoft (Their Broadcaster plugin inspired and helped me to make BroadcastTask)
- Daniktheboss (Build command)
